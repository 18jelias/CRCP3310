# Data: Narrative, Meaning and Discovery

I took this class in Spring of 2016, which studied the postmodern data analysis process: acquiring, parsing, filtering, mining, representing, refining and interacting. For this class, I studied different materials from studying what is data to learning the basics of  relational databases. We then transitioned to data mining and data visualizations for the end of the semester. 

The projects that are displayed on this repository are explained below: 

Project 1: This project visualizes the letter frequency of letters in Grimm's Fairy Tales. The second part of the project then visualizes the story by representing each character as a certain color. This project was created in Processing. 

Project 2: This project visualizes how each data structure operate. It contains two states: story and state mode. Story mode allows the moving objects to enter the add/delete stages to add or delete elements from each data structure. In state mode, the current state of each of these data structures are shown. This project was created in Processing. 

Project 4: This project created a basic song database. The user has the option to display all songs, add a new genre, add a new album, add a new artist or add a new song. The project uses sqlite3 and Ruby.
