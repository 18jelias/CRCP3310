# Data: Narrative, Meaning and Discovery

I took this class in Spring of 2016, which studied the postmodern data analysis process: acquiring, parsing, filtering, mining, representing, refining and interacting. For this class, I studied different materials from studying what is data to learning the basics of  relational databases. We then transitioned to data mining and data visualizations for the end of the semester.
